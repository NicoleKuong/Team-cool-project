        <i>"Reducing CO2 emissions due to preventing plastic pollution"</i>
      </h2>
      <h1>What is this project all about?</h1>

      <v-card class="mx-3 my-5 px-3 py-5">
        <h3 class="py-2">THE PROBLEM</h3>
        <p>
          The production, use and disposal of plastic produce prodigious amounts
          of greenhouse gasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s estimated that in 2019, the production and incineration of
          plastic has produced more than 850 million metric tons of greenhouse
          gases, which is equal to the emissions from 189 five-hundredmegawatt
          coal power plants!
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a significant need to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions
          through more sustainable reuse of plastic waste, that most often end
          up in developing countries. The core problem is that there are not
          enough incentives in place to clean up plastic waste in an organized
          manner.
        </p>
      </v-card>

      <v-card class="mx-3 my-5 px-3 py-5">
        <h3 class="py-2">OUR SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>
          We propose a network of <b>smart bins</b> connected to the internet
          and allocated across the areas where plastic waste is an issue. Every
          person collecting waste, enters their pin code onto the smart bin and
          dumps the collected waste into the smart bin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bin recognizes the type of plastic and therefore also its
          corresponding carbon footprint. The bin also recognizes the weight of
          the plastic. The software application confirms this immediately via
          <b>sms</b> to the <b>telephone</b> of the collector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Idea is to send money directly to the telephone balance via the
          telephone providor (‘money in the bank’ e.g. based on the stake they
          have in ‘sold raw plastic material’ to a producer) AS WELL AS hand out
          a token that serves like a stake in the ecoysystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          This two token system on the one hand has the
          <b>COOL Stablecoin</b> that immediately is sold into the CBDC Bakong
          (Central Bank Digital Currency, pegged to the Riel, local Cambodjan
          currency) and transferred as an incentive to the collector. This token
          receives its value from;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. Emission reduction rights</b>
          that companies are allowed to create with investments in
          emission-reduction projects in developing countries under the UNFCCC’s
          Clean Development Mechanism. Emission reduction rights are tradeable
          credits on public markets.
          <br />
          <b>2.</b> Income from the <b>sale</b> of the waste to recycling
          companies who use this waste as <b>raw material</b> for their
          production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other possible financial support can come from
          <b>government subsidies</b>, bin displays
          <b>ads from sponsors and partners as well as donors.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand the <b>EMISSION TOKEN</b>, represents
          <b>a share</b> in the ecosystem, acts as a <b>governance</b> token and
          is <b>utilized for payments</b> within the ecosystem. This also
          incentivizes the tokenholders to participate in and grow the
          ecosystem. The EMISSION TOKEN is available on the open market allowing
          some investment/speculative income for the holders. Investors like
          companies and individuals will be actively approached to add financial
          funds to an investment pool with the same purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          On short term a minimum investment of time and money is required to
          create the software, arrange for company and individuals buy in and
          bring value to the token. On long term the ‘token as a share’ should
          become more prevalent (see ‘long term vision’).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each collector can earn extra tokens when referring others and
          participate in ‘family pools’ or ‘municipality’ pools for extra
          tokens.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
          A view on these tokens, waste collected and turned in, money made and
          more can be viewed via an online wallet. ADD INFO ON THE WALLET AND
          ITS USAGE This wallet allows collectors to use as proof of savings &
          income to banks as a collateral for micro credits. Also, collectors
          can pool their funds and receive interest in return cq. directly take
          loans from decentralized finance protocols on the blockchain.

        <h3 class="py-2">LONG TERM VISION</h3>
        <p>
          On long term we foresee an autonomous ecosystem that sustains its own
          development. The main road for self sustainability is by using the
          governance rights of the token allowing people to vote for decisions
          made within the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          This works as follows. As more people over time gather these tokens
          into their wallets, they will be more stimulated to support increasing
          the value of the token. And the best way of increasing this value is
          by participating in the ecosystem by e.g. finding new uses of the
          wastage, finding more wastage, by enlarging the number of
          participants, supporting to create software, find new ideas as well as
          support decision making by exercising voting rights.
