        <v-card-subtitle>
          For every recycled product you recycle at on of our bins you receive
          tokens. You will receive a Plastic and an Emission token. The Plastic
          token is a stable token and it's value is connected to the value of
          the USD. The emission token can fluctuate in value and can be
          interesting for investors.
